    "A bit of noemclature for describing this graph is in order.   Firstly, we read this computation graph *from left to right* starting with the input node representing $w$ and ending with the full computation of $g\\left(w\\right)$.  Each *node* (after the input on the left, colored yellow) in the graph represents *a single elementary function or operation*, and is marked as such, and the arrows conecting pairs of nodes are called *directed edges* which show how computation flows when computing a value $g(w)$.  The words *parent* and *child* are often used to describe the local topology of a computation graphs, or in other words two nodes connected in a graph by a single edge.  The parent node is the one taking in the other node as input, or where the arrow points to.  The child node is the input of the parent, or where the arrow originates.  Because these terms / relationships are defined locally a particular node can be both a parent and a child with respect to other nodes in the graph. "
