    "For example in Genome-Wide Association (GWA) studies we aim to predict a quantitative biological trait like cholesterol level (**regression**) or diagnose a disease like breast cancer (**classification**) using more than 20,000 genetic markers (**features**) across the human genome. It is known among biologists that the vast majority of genes have little or no effect on the presence or severity of most diseases. L1-regualirized models are therefore used in situations like this, allowing only a few of the thousands of possible genes to be selected by the model (**sparse feature selection**), resulting in predictive models with enhanced accuracy and human interpretability."
